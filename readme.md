# Lung Cancer Detection using Machine Learning

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for detecting lung cancer using various machine learning techniques. The project aims to assist in early detection of lung cancer by analyzing patient data, performing visualizations, and building predictive models.

## Project Structure

- `Lungs Cancer.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook containing:
  - Data loading and preprocessing
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Visualizations
  - Model training and evaluation
  - Conclusions and possible future improvements

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains medical records and attributes relevant to lung cancer diagnosis (e.g., age, gender, smoking habits, symptoms). It is assumed to be either publicly available or imported directly into the notebook.

Note: The dataset itself is not included in this repository. Make sure to place the dataset in the correct path if you wish to rerun the notebook.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## How to Run

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

**Step 1:** Clone the repository
